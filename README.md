# Design Critique Cards

[David de Leon’s design critique cards](https://medium.com/@Prozpero/design-critique-cards-6cdad3f1406f) are a great way of unblocking the creative process. This mini webapp allows you to flip out a random piece of inspiration.

## Browser compatibility

I’m not looking for this to be hugely backwards compatible to old browsers, but I want it to be technically accessible. If you find any accessibility bugs then please let me know.
